SQL Programming

I have finally gathered some free time to work on SQL. Granted I have been consistent with Python, I will now be able to focus on them both. 

I will be worrking from Murach's SQL Server 2012 for the first run through then I will move to Murachs SQL Server 2016 to go through updated text.
